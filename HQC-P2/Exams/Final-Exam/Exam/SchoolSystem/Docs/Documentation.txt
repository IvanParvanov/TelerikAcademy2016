#1 - Student.cs -> ListMarks() method does not output "This student has no marks." when Marks.Count == 0
#2 - Student.cs -> ListMarks() doesn't append "The student has these marks:" in front of the marks.

#4 - Student.cs -> Adding more than 20 marks per student was possible.
#5 - Grade.cs -> grades 1 - 7 were missing
#6 - CreateStudentCommand -> Allows the creation of students with invalid Grades (negative and more than 12), also valid for CreateTeacher
